    <h1 class="title">DAYDREAM</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <div class="box">For my final website, I want to create an experience focusing on daydreaming.
                I plan on creating a comic-based story that uses scrolling elements, sound elements, and some hand-drawn animations. 
                The story is told through comic book frames that scroll into view as the user scrolls down the page. 
                The story will be told through text elements (speech bubbles and narration blocks) 
                and the sound elements will be elements of background chatter, news clips, and nature sounds. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="box">The story is told as comic panels that switch between the real world (a conversation with 2 friends) 
                and imagination (the daydreaming of one of the friends). The style differences between the real world and 
                imagination play a part in telling the story. Beginning in reality, the 2 characters are seen sitting at a cafe, 
                one friend is talking while the other friend is daydreaming; in the daydream, the character is engaging in 
                adrenaline-pumping activities in nature (cliffjumping, diving, running through forest), after a few switches 
                between daydreaming and reality, the talking friend finally asks the daydreaming friend what’s up and the 
                daydreamer breaks from their daydream. The daydreamer expresses sentiment about feeling stress in the world 
                and we see another view inside their head, this time seeing depictions of upsetting recent-world events. 
                After talking about what has been stressing them with their friend, the daydreamer feels a weight lifted off 
                their shoulders, and we see this through a shift in the visual elements. At the end of the story, I want to 
                include a blurb talking about escapism daydreaming relating to stress.

            <div class="box">Maladaptive daydreaming has seen a steady increase in the last 2 decades and there have been 
                links between this and increased global stress. Individuals who are prone to this behaviour are more deeply 
                affected by these stresses the more they daydream (Nowacki et al, 2024). I want to share the fact that 
                maladaptive daydreaming is significantly associated with self-escapism (Pyszkowska et al, 2023) and finally 
                offer links to mental health resources (There is an app i like to use called calm that offers some great ideas, 
                but I dont wan’t the website ot just be an ad for them (https://www.calm.com/blog/how-to-be-more-present)).</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="box">Dreams and reality initially have distinctly contrasting elements: the real world is black and white, 
                with distinct and blocky lineart and a serif font (Bodoni), background chatter and city noises playing as 
                background sound elements. The imagined world is very bright and colorful, with sketchy, loose lineart, and 
                incorporating simple 2d animation elements (character jumping from cliff into water, swimming underwater) 
                and a loose sans-serif font (Westmeath); nature and ocean noises are heard in the background while these 
                elements are in view. There is also another distinct style seen when the daydreamer expresses what has been 
                stressing them. In these panels we see depictions of real-world news events, with an even sharper, blockier 
                lineart style, with red and black being the only colors and a variation of the real world’s serif font (Bodoni ExtraBold). 
                This area will also have a distinct sound element of overlapping news broadcatsts. Towards the end, the visual styles 
                of the real world and imagination merge, and the color elements from the imagined world meet the lineart of the real world, 
                and a font somewhere between the serif font (Bodoni) and the loose style of the sans-serif font (Westmeath) is 
                used (Forte), the sound elements also merge, with nature sounds joining the city sounds. </div>

            <div class="box">Some of the main challenges I think I will face with this project are properly managing so many images 
                in one scrolling page, particularly when some of them will contain animation elements, also, creating a smooth experience 
                with the various sounds in time with the image elements. I want the images to dynamically enter and exit the viewport, 
                and I don’t want the sound to abruptly cut between the different elements. I plan on doing the scrolling elements first 
                and figuring out how to do the sounds, just using placeholder images until i have the dynamic scroll I want, then make 
                the image elements. One of my first steps is writing out this story so I know how many panels I will incorporate and 
                how long it will be. </div>
